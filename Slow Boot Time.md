# It could be your boot drive is getting a bit full, and not operating at peak performance. You might have too many programs trying to start alongside Windows, or your hardware could just be getting a bit old. There are some solutions to figure out this problem:

* 1.Disable Fast Startup: Fast Startup is a default-enabled feature in Windows 10. It is supposed to reduce startup time by pre-loading some boot information before your PC shuts off.  It works similarly as Hibernation.

* 2.Disable Processes with High Startup Impact: Some unnecessary processes with high startup impact can make your Windows 10 computer boot slowly. You can disable those processes to fix your problem. 

* 3.Update your graphics card driver: You can do this manually by downloading the latest drivers from your graphics card manufacturer’s official website. You’ll need to find exactly the correct driver, though. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, or if you want to save some time, you can use Driver Easy to do it automatically. 

* 4.Do a clean install of Windows 10: If none of the previous three tips worked, you can choose to do a clean install of Windows 10 on your computer.
